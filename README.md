> [PubMedSearch ↓](https://hub.knime.com/-/spaces/-/~lsAgLUrDgrQ_YdN8/current-state/) This PubMedSearch component enables the search for life sciences and biomedical topics in PubMed, a free search engine developed and maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Library of Medicine (NLM). It performs a search on PubMed and returns a table with the search results, including the Title, Abstract, Journal, Publication Year, and DOI. To use it, form your query in the PubMed Query box in Advanced Search. Double-click the component to paste the query string into the Query box. Please note that if the search yields no results, the component will fail.
